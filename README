ShowMySnippet is a MIT-licensed JavaScript code to easily render some HTML code inside an HTML document.
Created by [Remi Grumeau](http://www.we-are-gurus.com) for the need of the [iUI Mobile Web Framework](http://www.iui-js.org) documentation.

No big deal, it's just a few lines of Javascript that i thought some could find useful too.
